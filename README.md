## Computer Vision with MATLAB

## Ball Segmentation

* ðŸš€ðŸŒŸIn this project, you can learn importing and playing videos and preprocessing for segmentation in Matlab.

* ***importing_video.mlx*** is a live script file which you can run the codes and see the result section by section.

* After running importing_video you can see the variables in the workspace widget. You should save the videoFrame variable as ball_frames.mat file.

* ðŸŒŸ Then you can run ball_egmentation.mlx  


> # All these steps for just one frame. Now you can run the ***ball_seg_for_all_frames.m*** and see what happens! ðŸš€
